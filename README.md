VisualKit-Lab
VisualKit-Lab is an experimental laboratory that combines external hardware with generative artificial intelligence to create real-time, continuous-flow art. The project uses an ESP-EYE as external hardware, capturing live video and streaming it to a Python backend. This backend communicates with the Stability.ai API to receive responses from the generative model and combines them to create live and continuously fluid art.

Key Components
Firmware for ESP32: The firmware allows the ESP-EYE to work plug-and-play, automatically connecting to the Wi-Fi network and streaming live video to the backend.

Python Backend: The backend receives the video stream from the ESP-EYE, processes it using generative artificial intelligence models, and returns the responses to the frontend for visualization.

Custom Frontend: The project includes a custom frontend designed in your style to visualize and enjoy the real-time generated art.
